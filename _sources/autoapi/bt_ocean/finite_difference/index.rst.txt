.. py:function:: order_reversed(alpha, beta)

   
   Defines a reversed grid point ordering. Can be used as the
   `interior_order` or `boundary_order` argument for :func:`.diff_bounded`.


   :Parameters:

       **alpha** : Sequence
           Coefficients.

       **beta** : Sequence
           Displacements



   :Returns:

       tuple
           Reordered coefficients.

       tuple
           Reordered displacements.

.. py:function:: diff_bounded(u, dx, order, N, *, axis=-1, i0=None, i1=None, boundary_expansion=None, interior_order=None, boundary_order=None)

   
   Compute a centered finite difference approximation for a derivative for
   data stored on a uniform grid. Result is defined on the same grid as the
   input (i.e. without staggering). Transitions to one-sided differencing as
   the end-points are approached.


   :Parameters:

       **u** : :class:`jax.Array`
           Field to difference.

       **dx** : Real
           Grid spacing.

       **order** : Integral
           Derivative order.

       **N** : Integral
           Number of grid points in the difference approximation. Centered
           differencing uses an additional right-sided point if `N` is even.

       **axis** : Integral
           Axis.

       **i0** : Integral
           Index lower limit. Values with index less than the index defined by
           `i0` are set to zero.

       **i1** : Integral
           Index upper limit. Values with index greater than or equal to the index
           defined by `i1` are set to zero.

       **boundary_expansion** : bool
           Whether to use one additional grid point for one-sided differencing
           near the boundary. Defaults to `True` if `order` is even and `False`
           otherwise.

       **interior_order** : callable
           Used to define an ordering for interior grid points. See
           :func:`.ordering_reversed` for an example. Note that a positive
           displacement corresponds to an increasing index.

       **boundary_order** : callable
           Used to define an ordering for boundary grid points. See
           :func:`.ordering_reversed` for an example. Note that a positive
           displacement corresponds to a domain inward direction.



   :Returns:

       :class:`jax.Array`
           Finite difference approximation.

.. py:function:: diff_periodic(u, dx, order, N, *, axis=-1, interior_order=None)

   
   Compute a centered finite difference approximation for a derivative for
   data stored on a uniform grid. Result is defined on the same grid as the
   input (i.e. without staggering). Applies periodic boundary conditions.

   Arguments and return value are as for :func:`.diff_bounded`.
